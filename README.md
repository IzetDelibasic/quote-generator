# React Quote Generator

This project represents my first React application, which allows users to get quotes and advice from a quote generator.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Displaying the Current Quote:** Upon opening the application, you will see the current quote of the day, which is automatically generated from our database of quotes.

2. **Fetching a New Quote:** By clicking the "Give Me Advice" button, you can receive a new randomly selected quote from our database.

3. **Choosing Quotes of the Day:** If you want to save a particular quote of the day that you find inspiring, simply click the heart icon next to the quote. This will make that quote your personal quote of the day and it will be displayed every time you open the application.

## Technical Details

- The application is built using the React framework.
- Quotes are obtained from a quote generator and displayed on the homepage.
- The functionality of saving quotes of the day is achieved using React's state management system.
- The design of the application is simple and user-friendly.
